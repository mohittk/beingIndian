            India is a land of festivals and fairs. Virtually celebrating each
            day of the year, there are more festivals celebrated in India than
            anywhere else in the world. Each festival pertains to different
            occasions, some welcome the seasons of the year, the harvest, the
            rains, or the full moon. Others celebrate religious occasions, the
            birthdays of divine beings and saints, or the advent of the New
            Year. A number of these festivals are common to most parts of India.
            However, they may be called by different names in various parts of
            the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion. Some of the
            festivals celebrated all over India are mentioned below. However,
